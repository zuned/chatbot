 Description: When any error condition happen on server where application is running , the message is sent to developer machine.
 
 Now Devloper can talk to machine to get more information about the server for eg: weather server resource issue or some error happing in logs. And take action accordingly.
 
 So developer is talking to machine :)
 
 That si the crux of the POC.
 
Thanks,
